# Game Discription
In my game you will need to use the buttons to click when needed. You will need to use the switch to turn the game off and on and if turned off the game will be reset. There will be one LED that is lit up blue which is chosen randomly then another LED that is red that circles around the 10 total LEDs. When the LED that is circling around goes over the lit up LED you will need to click either one of the buttons and if clicked at the right time you will have completed the level. The game will give you a point and advance you to the next level. If you fail the level, the LEDs will light up a pattern indicating you have lost and it will restart back at level one. Each level will get faster and faster and at the end of the game if you complete all 5 levels you will have won and the LEDs will display a pattern showing you have won.
